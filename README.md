# What can be done with Polyel?
Polyel is an MVC (Model-View-Controller) PHP framework based on the Swoole networking library, which is a C++ extension written for PHP and runs as a CLI application, allowing you to build high-performance web applications using both synchronous and asynchronous programming.

A framework that brings everything together, providing features to make web development quicker and more secure. Some features include built-in support for authentication and authorization, XSS filtering, CSRF protection, database query builder support, async email sending, input validation, time manipulation, built-in templating & view service, message management and much more...

Allowing you to create highly scalable applications and with support for web sockets, concurrent connections, Task workers, connection pools, async MySQL and non-blocking I/O programming.

# Features

- Fast, easy to use Routing Engine with built in automatic caching
- An async database query builder
- Database read & write connection pool
- Custom built DIC (Container) where everything is preloaded (even controllers), speeding up requests
- Easy to use and fast session management system
- MVC framework model built around a async paradigm
- Quick, elegant and simple built in view templating engine
- Simple configuration management right from the start
- Built in Coroutine support based on Swoole PHP
- Fast Middleware system, preloaded during server boot up
- File storage service (Planned support for FTP and cloud storage)
- Automatic XSS filtering & CSRF protection
- Element templates; handles rendering dynamic page components with logic and data
- MVC Services built around the Swoole async model, services can be local and global

# Planned Features & Roadmap
The planned development feature list for the Polyel framework:
- A complete HTTP server with built-in support for Ajax & web sockets
- Redis client which supports different use cases
- Powerful and flexible built-in logger
- Built-in feature rich modules such as: Time processing, message system, flash messaging, markdown parser, email sending, data validation, pagination etc.
- Automatic SSL assigning using Let's Encrypt
- Job task system
- Cache service
- Specifically designed debug methods to support the Swoole paradigm
- Async event system

With many more features planned...

# Motivation
**Another framework you ask?** Well, this project originally started as a set of classes to test the features of the Swoole networking library for PHP. Overtime as more services were built which were used to try out the ability of Swoole, the project formed into a fully featured web framework based on a new async/coroutine programming model that has not really been seen before with PHP. 

Compared to other frameworks or adaptors based around Swoole, Polyel is built from the ground up, supporting the event-driven, asynchronous, non-blocking I/O nature of Swooles programming model. Polyel aims to be a fully featured option for when you want to build a modern PHP web application with Swoole, Polyel is designed to have minimal dependencies other than Swoole, making it easy and flexible to adapt and move forward with the async/coroutine paradigm that Swoole provides, also following mature standards and best practices, so you may find Polyel very similar to other frameworks, helping adoption and enabling developers to get started quickly.
